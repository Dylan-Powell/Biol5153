RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

Aug. 2022 – Present
Graduate Research Assistant, University of Arkansas

June. 2020 – July. 2022
Graduate Research Assistant, Central Michigan University
Tested the efficacy of using environmental DNA to detect the endangered Snuffbox mussel.
  •	Assisted the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) with collecting water samples.
  •	Logistically coordinated sample collections with the USFWS.
  •	Extracted DNA for use in downstream PCR under sterile conditions in a fume hood.
  •	Ran Real-Time PCR assays using an ABI7500.
  •	Created site maps using ArcGIS online.
  •	Knowledge of multivariate statistical techniques such as MANOVA, NMDS, CART models (randomforest).
  •	Collected data, created presentations, and presented findings at research conferences.
Assisted with invasive snail surveys in inland Michigan Lakes. 
  •	Utilized a D-net to conduct sediment and macroinvertebrate surveys. 
  •	Gained experience identifying snails to the family level.
Assisted with St. Clair River SCUBA surveys.
  •	Took ponar sediment samples for dreissenid and gastropod composition analysis. 
  •	SCUBA dove river sites to find live mussels and shells. 
Other skills
  •	Assisted with traditional mussel surveying including timed searches and quadrat searches. 
  •	Obtained experience identifying unionid and dreissenid mussel species.
  •	Aided monitoring of a federally endangered freshwater mussel (Epioblasma triquetra) at Lyons, Michigan.
  •	Informed the public about freshwater mussels and scientific concerns.

Aug. 2017 – May. 2020
Undergraduate Research Assistant, Iowa State University
